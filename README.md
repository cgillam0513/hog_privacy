1. Overview

History On the Go (“the App”) is designed to provide location-based audio playback of historical markers as users drive, walk, or bike past them. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and your choices regarding that data.

2. Information We Collect

Location Information:  The App uses location data to determine when you are near a historical marker.  Location access may be used while the app is in use and/or in the background, depending on your settings.  Location data is processed on-device and is not stored, tracked over time, or sold.

Usage Data (Optional / Aggregate):  Basic, anonymous usage statistics may be collected to improve app performance (e.g., number of markers triggered).  This data does not personally identify you.

Audio & Media:  The App plays audio descriptions of historical markers.  The App does not record audio, access your microphone, or collect voice data.

3. Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:  Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact lists; Precise travel history logs; Advertising identifiers; Payment information (unless required for App Store purchases, handled by Apple); Photos, files, or personal content

4. How We Use Information

We use information solely to:  Trigger historical marker audio at the correct location; Improve app reliability and performance; Enable core functionality of the App; We do not use your data for advertising or profiling.

5. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.  Data may be shared only if required by law or to comply with legal obligations.

6. Third-Party Services

The App may rely on:  Apple’s location services; Apple App Store services for purchases and subscriptions;  These services are governed by Apple’s own privacy policies.

7. Background Location Use

If enabled, the App may access location data in the background to announce nearby historical markers while driving or traveling. You can control or revoke this permission at any time in your device settings.

8. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information. Since most processing occurs on-device and minimal data is collected, risk exposure is limited.

9. Children’s Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13. If you believe such data has been collected, please contact us and it will be promptly deleted.

10. Your Choices

You may:  Disable location access in iOS Settings; Use the App without background location access (with reduced functionality); Delete the App at any time to stop all data collection
